# FLICKERS SMARTICLES

Flickers Smarticles is a movie trivia quiz game for the movie fans. It covers a range of difficulties to cater from the most novice to the most die-hard fans of the Hollywood blockbuster movie industry. The questions are interesting, fun, and even educational.

The brand Flickers Smarticles is a play on the words: Flicker being an expression for the flickering images of the old movies, and a way of describing types of movies, such as Chick Flicks for romantic comedies; and Smarticles is a play on the word Smart, implying that the game players are smart movie fans paying attention to the details in films.

## UX

Game is designed using Python default view in black screen. 


## Features

The game is based on the opentdb.com open API for trivia game questions. The API created for this game speficially pulls 20 randomly selected questions each time the game starts, along with 3 incorrect and 1 correct answer. The quiz questions are different in each game, and the order of the multiple choice answers are re-shuffled in each game to ensure the answer is not always the same option. This prevents the game from becoming too easy and repetitive. 

The game validates player's answer inputs and only accepts the answer in the valid input type. It also offers replayability by offering the player to start a new game at the end of one. Each correct answer counts towards a score of one which creates a sense of achievement as the player will try to increase their score each time. 

### Game Flow

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the game and the planning process.

![Game Flow](documentation/images/game-flow-diagram.png)
 
### Existing Features

- **OpenTDB Game API**

    - The game is based on Open TDB game trivia database API to ensure that the question base is not small and repetitive and continuously gets updated by public contributions. The answer options come available through the API with over 4,000 questions.
    
[API_URL https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=20&category=11&type=multiple](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=20&category=11&type=multiple) 

![Open TDB Trivia Database API](documentation/images/opentdb-trivia.png)

- **Game Score**

    - Player earns 1 point for each correct answer out of 20 questions answered. 

![Scores](documentation/images/game-score.png)

- **Reshuffle Order of Answer Choices**

    - OpenTDB API provides 3 incorrect and 1 correct answer options for each question. However, the incorrect answers come through in the same order each time. For this reason, Flickers Smarticles game re-shuffles the order of the multiple choice answer options each time the question is displayed to the player. This reduces the predictability and ensures that the player must read answer options each time. 

![Reshuffle Answers](documentation/images/reshuffle-answers.png)

- **Removal of Bad Characters from the API**

    - Open TDB questions and answers are full of bad characters that appear illegible to the player. These are mostly apostrophes, such as &quot;, &#039;, &ldquo;, ,&rdquo;, &amp;; but also the French letter e with accent (&egrave;), and the three dots for ellipsis (&hellip;). These are replaced using the .replace in Python before they're displayed to the player. 

![Bad Characters](documentation/images/bad-characters.png)

- **Numbered List for Multiple Choice Options**

    - Prefixes in the form of 1-2-3-4 is added to the beginning of each multiple choice answer to make it easy for the player to enter their answer. 

![API Multiple Choices](documentation/images/api-multiple-choice.png)
![Numbered List Multiple Choices](documentation/images/numbered-multiple-choice.png)

- **Use of Colours**

    - To make the questions and answers more legible and the correct and incorrect answer announcements more interesting, use of colours have been utilised. 

![Colours](documentation/images/colours-text.png)

- **Input Validation**

    - Player is requested to enter one of 1-2-3-4 as an answer choice to the multiple choice questions. If the input is anything other than these four numbers, a while loop has been implemented that keeps asking the player to enter the correct type of input. This validation includes any letters, special characters and also any number outside of 1-2-3-4. 

![Colours](documentation/images/input-choices.png)

- **Replayability**

    - Player is prompted to play again once the game is completed. requested to enter one of 1-2-3-4 as an answer choice to the multiple choice questions. If the input is anything other than these four numbers, a while loop has been implemented that keeps asking the player to enter the correct type of input. This validation includes any letters, special characters and also any number outside of 1-2-3-4. 

![Colours](documentation/images/game-over.png)

### Future Features

- Select Level of Difficulty 
    - The API allows for categorisation of questions according to level of difficulty. This game can incorporate that and offer it as an option to the player. The player can select their level or difficulty at the start of the game. 
- Game Progression 
    - The game could start from an easy level and allow the player to progress to higher levels with increased difficulty as they complete previous levels.
- Save Past Scores 
    - Player's past scores and all time best scores could be saved and be available upon subsequent visits. 
- Registration and Login 
    - Player could register a game account and login to see their past scores and games.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org) used as the back-end programming language.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) used for version control. (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- [GitHub](https://github.com) used for secure online code storage.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) used for hosting the deployed front-end site.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) used as a cloud-based IDE for development.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) used for hosting the deployed back-end site.

### Classes & Functions

The program uses classes as a blueprint for the project's objects (OOP). This allows for the object to be reusable.

```python
class Person:
    """ Insert docstring comments here """
    def __init__(self, name, age, health, inventory):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.health = health
        self.inventory = inventory
```

The primary functions used on this application are:

- `get_sales_data()`
    - Get sales figures input from the user.
- `validate_data()`
    - Converts all string values into integers.
- `update_worksheet()`
    - Update the relevant worksheet with the data provided.
- `calculate_surplus_data()`
    - Compare sales with stock and calculate the surplus for each item type.
- `get_last_5_entries_sales()`
    - Collects columns of data from sales worksheet.
- `calculate_stock_data()`
    -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%.
- `main()`
    - Run all program functions.

### Imports

I've used the following Python packages and/or external imported packages.

- `json`: 
- `requests`: 
- `colorama`: used for including color in the terminal
- `random`: used to get a random choice from a list

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


## Code Validation

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

The CI Python Linter can be used two different ways.
- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click on.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).
    - Examples:

    | File | CI URL | Raw URL | Combined |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | PP3 *run.py* file | `https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles/main/run.py` | https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles/main/run.py |
    | Boutique Ado *settings.py* | `https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles/main/boutique_ado/settings.py` | https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles/main/boutique_ado/settings.py |

It's recommended to validate each file using the API URL.
This will give you a custom URL which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a file to validate it again in the future.
Use the steps above to generate your own custom URLs for each Python file.

**NOTE**: You must include 2 *spaces* before the `#`, and 1 *space* after the `#`.

Do not use `# noqa` all over your project just to clear down validation errors!
This can still cause a project to fail, for failing to fix actual PEP8 validation errors.

Sometimes strings or variables get too long, or long `if` conditional statements.
These are acceptable instances to use the `# noqa`.

When trying to fix "line too long" errors, try to avoid using `/` to split lines.
A better approach would be to use any type of opening bracket, and hit Enter just after that.
Any opening bracket type will work: `(`, `[`, `{`.
By using an opening bracket, Python knows where to appropriately indent the next line of code,
without having to "guess" yourself and attempt to tab to the correct indentation level.


## Lighthouse Audit

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | Some minor warnings |
| Home | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Few warnings |
| About | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-mobile.png) | Some minor warnings |
| About | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-desktop.png) | Few warnings |
| Gallery | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-gallery-mobile.png) | Slow response time due to large images |
| Gallery | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-gallery-desktop.png) | Slow response time due to large images |
| x | x | x | repeat for any other tested pages/sizes |

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | User Action | Expected Result | Pass/Fail | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home Page | | | | |
| | Click on Logo | Redirection to Home page | Pass | |
| | Click on Home link in navbar | Redirection to Home page | Pass | |
| Gallery Page | | | | |
| | Click on Gallery link in navbar | Redirection to Gallery page | Pass | |
| | Load gallery images | All images load as expected | Pass | |
| Contact Page | | | | |
| | Click on Contact link in navbar | Redirection to Contact page | Pass | |
| | Enter first/last name | Field will accept freeform text | Pass | |
| | Enter valid email address | Field will only accept email address format | Pass | |
| | Enter message in textarea | Field will accept freeform text | Pass | |
| | Click the Submit button | Redirects user to form-dump | Pass | User must click 'Back' button to return |
| Sign Up | | | | |
| | Click on Sign Up button | Redirection to Sign Up page | Pass | |
| | Enter valid email address | Field will only accept email address format | Pass | |
| | Enter valid password (twice) | Field will only accept password format | Pass | |
| | Click on Sign Up button | Asks user to confirm email page | Pass | Email sent to user |
| | Confirm email | Redirects user to blank Sign In page | Pass | |
| Log In | | | | |
| | Click on the Login link | Redirection to Login page | Pass | |
| | Enter valid email address | Field will only accept email address format | Pass | |
| | Enter valid password | Field will only accept password format | Pass | |
| | Click Login button | Redirects user to home page | Pass | |
| Log Out | | | | |
| | Click Logout button | Redirects user to logout page | Pass | Confirms logout first |
| | Click Confirm Logout button | Redirects user to home page | Pass | |
| Profile | | | | |
| | Click on Profile button | User will be redirected to the Profile page | Pass | |
| | Click on the Edit button | User will be redirected to the edit profile page | Pass | |
| | Click on the My Orders link | User will be redirected to the My Orders page | Pass | |
| | Brute forcing the URL to get to another user's profile | User should be given an error | Pass | Redirects user back to own profile |

Repeat for all other tests, as applicable to your own site.
The aforementioned tests are just an example of a few different project scenarios.

## Bugs

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

For JavaScript and Python applications, it's best to screenshot the errors to include them as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug03.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Django `TemplateDoesNotExist` at /appname/path appname/template_name.html

### GitHub **Issues**

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

**Fixed Bugs**

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://github.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://flickers-smarticles.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as CREDS.JSON, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If using any confidential credentials, such as `CREDS.json` or `env.py` data, these will need to be manually added to your own newly created project as well.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shadeofpurple79/flickers-smarticles)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
